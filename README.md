# To Do List
My to-do list project, created using Java/Eclipse, is a to-do list application. 
It allows you to add, edit, and remove tasks and keeps track of the number of tasks you have.

# Installation
Download the Java project file and import it into an IDE to run the application.

# Usage
This app can be used to keep track of your daily tasks, such as chores, school work, etc.

# Project Status
This project/application works for the most part, but once there is more than one task, you can only remove the bottom task and none of the rest.
